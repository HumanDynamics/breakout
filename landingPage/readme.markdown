# Breakout landing Page

Landing page template for Breakout.

We have several different versions of Breakout running in the wild, and they have some customized landing pages. 

The biggest step here is to make sure that the Hangout Button points to the correct App ID.

In the repo, it points to [The Real Breakout](https://breakout.media.mit.edu)

Built with [Base](http://getbase.org).
